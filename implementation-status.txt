* Responsible Activity: WelcomeFragment.java , SettingsFragment.java

 [ X ] Complete.
 [ ] Incomplete.

 Remarks: For the welcome fragment, I decided to give some words of advice
about the safe usage of drugs instead of meshing togheter recent posts/comments
becaus eit was overlapping too greatly with my teamates' parts. I worked on the
"Send feedback" part of SettingsFragment.

* Extra: Encryption of local database

 [ X ] Complete
 [ ] Incomplete

 Remarks: If we look at the data by rooting the device, it is unreadable, gibberish!
I wish I could have had user-dependent key (everything is in place for it) but time-constraints
didn't allow me to fix unexpected bugs that happen when we switch user.

* Responsible Activity: Login Fragment,Create User Fragment,Browse Exp Fragment,Post Experience Fragment

 [X] Complete.
 [ ] Incomplete.

 Remarks: I was responsible for login and browsing experiences made from users retrieved from the server.
 I was also responsible for creating users page and creating fragments page. They are both functional. However
 they were not exactly what are orignal goal was. This mostly applied to comments. We wanted to allow users to
 create comments on a experience. But this was very challenging and I could not get it to work. However you
 can still see what people's experiences that are posted. Overall while these two activities could be much improved
 they are both still fully functional.

* Extra: Push Notifications

 [X] Complete
 [ ] Incomplete

 Remarks: This was a strange extra due it being very specific to which gradle version you were using and what phone.
 It did indeed work in the end however it only seems to work on newer phones. They make it extremely difficult for
 it to work on older phone without third party software. The Nexus 6 was the phone I worked with and it worked.

* Responsible Activity: ReminderFragment, SettingsFragment(small part for my extra)

 [X] Complete.
 [ ] Incomplete.

 Remarks: It was really interesting to make the fragment. Mainly due to the fact that every susbtance is handled
 differently in many ways, for example, alcohol has concentration, caffeine comes in many different "formats" 
 but each format doesn't usually have the caffeine content readily available, so each of its possible forms had to
 have their own information stored, etc. My only regret is not having had time to implement more substances for the
 calculations, or to implement a lot more variables in the calculations (user weight, user height, gender, age, etc)
 But it would have added much more work on the information itself and not the Android part, so I had to focus on the
 most common substances and their average instead.

* Extra: Widget + Emergency text message

 [X] Complete
 [ ] Incomplete

 Remarks: The widget was surpringly not as much of a challenge as I originally thought, Android Studio was well made 
 in the sense that it guided you through the steps to create the widget the way you want it. The biggest challenge I
 encountered was storing the information entered in the app to also be available OUTSIDE of the app in the widget. 
 Though that issue had to be fixed in order for the data to remain even after the app was closed (Didn't want to user
 a database solely for one row of two fields). Also, after having implemented the widget text function, I figured it 
 would be easy to implement the emergency function directly in the app if a dangerous amount of drugs was to be consumed.
 (Try putting a ridiculous amount of alcohol for example, you'll get a notification that asks you if you want to contact
 your emergency number)

  Very much enjoyed working on the project, as it is something that I can see myself using (For the caffeine and alcohol
  part, especially with tolerance 0 alcohol for driving). However, I would need to spend much more time refining the 
  calculations (and variables taken in consideration) before I would rely on it with confidence. I didn't want to spend 
  more time on the "data" and to not have any time left to spend on the app, so I prefered to add more functionalities 
  rather than static data. Also, I really think the emergency text widget can be useful in more than one situation, and
  even though I wouldn't 100% rely on the timer/calculations (due to the lack of variables taken into consideration: weight,
  age,gender, etc.) the emergency widget is the part of the app in which I'm the most confident, and even if it's not for a 
  "drug" related situation, I think it can be truly useful to be able to preset a number and message in advance and to be 
  able to send it in just a few presses.
