* Responsible Activity: WelcomeFragment.java , SettingsFragment.java

 [ X ] Complete.
 [ ] Incomplete.

 Remarks: For the welcome fragment, I decided to give some words of advice
about the safe usage of drugs instead of meshing togheter recent posts/comments
becaus eit was overlapping too greatly with my teamates' parts. I worked on the
"Send feedback" part of SettingsFragment.

* Extra: Encryption of local database

 [ X ] Complete
 [ ] Incomplete

 Remarks: If we look at the data by rooting the device, it is unreadable, gibberish!
I wish I could have had user-dependent key (everything is in place for it) but time-constraints
didn't allow me to fix unexpected bugs that happen when we switch user.

* Responsible Activity: Login Fragment,Create User Fragment,Browse Exp Fragment,Post Experience Fragment

 [X] Complete.
 [ ] Incomplete.

 Remarks: I was responsible for login and browsing experiences made from users retrieved from the server.
 I was also responsible for creating users page and creating fragments page. They are both functional. However
 they were not exactly what are orignal goal was. This mostly applied to comments. We wanted to allow users to
 create comments on a experience. But this was very challenging and I could not get it to work. However you
 can still see what people's experiences that are posted. Overall while these two activities could be much improved
 they are both still fully functional.

* Extra: Push Notifications

 [X] Complete
 [ ] Incomplete

 Remarks: This was a strange extra due it being very specific to which gradle version you were using and what phone.
 It did indeed work in the end however it only seems to work on newer phones. They make it extremely difficult for
 it to work on older phone without third party software. The Nexus 6 was the phone I worked with and it worked.
